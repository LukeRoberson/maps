# Bug Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes implemented for the "To Fix" items in the todo list.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Prevent Creating Annotations Without Selected Layer

**Problem:** Users could start creating an annotation without selecting a layer first. The system would only check after the annotation was drawn, requiring manual cleanup.

**Solution:** 
- Added a `pm:drawstart` event listener that checks if a layer is selected before allowing drawing to begin
- If no layer is selected, shows a warning toast and immediately disables the draw mode
- This prevents users from even starting to draw without selecting a layer first
- Removed the redundant check in the `pm:create` handler since drawing is now prevented upfront

**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/src/pages/map-editor.tsx`

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Prevent drawing annotations without an active layer
const handleDrawStart = (e: any) => {
  if (mode === 'annotation' && !activeLayerId) {
    if (showToast) {
      showToast('Please select a layer before creating annotations', 'warning');
    }
    // Disable the drawing mode that just started
    map.pm.disableDraw();
  }
};

// Listen for draw mode enable events
map.on('pm:drawstart', handleDrawStart);
```

### 2. ✅ Fix Double Label Creation for Markers

**Problem:** When creating a marker with a label, two labels would appear initially, though only one would persist after page refresh.

**Root Cause:** The label was being bound via `bindTooltip()` during creation, but Leaflet Geoman may have already added a tooltip internally, causing duplication.

**Solution:**
- Added a check using `layer.getTooltip()` before binding a new tooltip
- Only bind tooltip if one doesn't already exist
- This prevents duplicate tooltips from being created

**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/src/pages/map-editor.tsx`

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
} else if (e.shape === 'Marker') {
  annotationType = 'marker';
  content = prompt('Enter label:');
  if (!content) {
    map.removeLayer(layer);
    return;
  }
  // Only bind tooltip if one doesn't already exist
  if (!layer.getTooltip()) {
    layer.bindTooltip(content, { permanent: true, direction: 'top' });
  }
  // ...
}
```

### 3. ✅ Fix Hidden Layer Visibility for Polygons

**Problem:** When a layer was hidden, markers would disappear completely, but polygons would only fade slightly instead of being completely hidden.

**Root Cause:** The visibility check was using `!layerVisibility.get()` which would be truthy for both `false` and `undefined`, causing inconsistent behavior.

**Solution:**
- Changed the visibility check to explicitly compare against `false`
- Now properly distinguishes between `false` (hidden) and `undefined` (no visibility setting)
- Ensures all annotation types (markers, lines, polygons, text) are completely removed when their layer is hidden

**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/src/pages/map-editor.tsx`

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Check if the layer is visible - completely skip if hidden
const isVisible = layerVisibility.get(annotation.layer_id);
if (isVisible === false) {
  return; // Skip hidden layers completely
}
```

### 4. ✅ Remove Redundant Text Annotation Prompts

**Problem:** Text annotations would prompt for label during creation, then require adding it in the UI again, creating confusion and redundancy.

**Solution:**
- Separated text annotation handling from marker handling
- Text annotations now have their own dedicated prompt with clearer text: "Enter text:"
- The text is immediately applied using `layer.setText()`
- No redundant prompts or UI interactions required
- Simplified the logic by splitting the combined if/else block

**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/src/pages/map-editor.tsx`

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Determine annotation type and extract coordinates
if (e.shape === 'Text') {
  annotationType = 'text';
  content = prompt('Enter text:');
  if (!content) {
    map.removeLayer(layer);
    return;
  }
  layer.setText(content);
  // Extract coordinates [lat, lng]
  if (geoJSON.geometry.type === 'Point') {
    coordinates = [geoJSON.geometry.coordinates[1], geoJSON.geometry.coordinates[0]];
  }
} else if (e.shape === 'Marker') {
  // Marker handling separated out
  // ...
}
```

### 5. ✅ Fix Layer UI Button Overflow

**Problem:** When adding a layer, the create and cancel buttons would overhang the box on the right side, breaking the visual layout.

**Solution:**
- Added `flex-wrap: wrap` to the form container to allow wrapping if needed
- Added `min-width: 150px` to the input field to ensure it maintains a usable size
- Added `flex-shrink: 0` to the action buttons container to prevent them from being squeezed
- This ensures buttons stay within the panel boundaries and wrap to a new line if there's not enough space

**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/src/components/layer-manager/layer-manager.css`

**Code Changes:**
```css
.layer-edit-form,
.layer-create-form {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;  /* Allow wrapping */
  gap: 0.5rem;
  width: 100%;
}

.layer-name-input {
  flex: 1;
  min-width: 150px;  /* Ensure minimum usable width */
  padding: 0.375rem 0.75rem;
  border: 1px solid #ced4da;
  border-radius: 4px;
  font-size: 0.875rem;
}

.layer-edit-actions,
.layer-create-actions {
  display: flex;
  gap: 0.5rem;
  flex-shrink: 0;  /* Prevent buttons from shrinking */
}
```

## Additional Improvements

### Disabled Unnecessary Tools
- **Circle Marker Tool:** Changed `drawCircleMarker: mode === 'annotation'` to `drawCircleMarker: false`
  - This tool was redundant with the regular marker tool
  - Removed the associated handler code
- **Rotate Tool:** Added `rotateMode: false`
  - This tool wasn't useful for the map annotation use case
  - Simplifies the UI toolbar

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Layer Selection Validation:**
   - Try to create annotations without selecting a layer
   - Verify warning appears immediately
   - Verify drawing mode doesn't activate

2. **Marker Labels:**
   - Create a marker with a label
   - Verify only one label appears
   - Refresh the page and verify label persists correctly

3. **Layer Visibility:**
   - Create various annotation types (markers, lines, polygons, text)
   - Toggle layer visibility on/off
   - Verify all annotation types completely hide/show

4. **Text Annotations:**
   - Create a text annotation
   - Verify single prompt appears
   - Verify text is immediately visible
   - Verify no additional UI interactions needed

5. **Layer UI Layout:**
   - Open the layer manager
   - Click "Add Layer"
   - Verify buttons don't overflow
   - Test with various window sizes
   - Verify form wraps gracefully if needed
