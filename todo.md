# To Do List

- [ ] Project view
  - [ ] Slider to hide suburbs with no child maps

- [ ] Map Editor
  - [ ] Enable map editor to go full screen (or close to it)
  - [ ] Suburb and region boundaries should have a different colour, so they stand out as different
  - [x] A new individual map boundary is initially green, but after a refresh it is red
    * Neighbouring maps should be green
    * Selected maps should be red
  - [x] Zoom in partial increments

- [ ] Annotation:
  - [ ] Change marker colour to match layer colour
  - [ ] Centre align text label to marker

- [ ] Layers:
  - [ ] In a region map, assign suburbs to a layer
  - [ ] Add a suburb label to the suburb polygon
  - [ ] Some for maps within suburb


# Bugs

- [ ] Changing bearing doesn't stick; As soon as we move the map, it resets
- [ ] Parent layers aren't being inherited
