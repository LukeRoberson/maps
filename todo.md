# To Do List

# API

- [ ] Improve the `config.py` file
  - [ ] Load config from a YAML file
  - [ ] Set the secret key securely in prod


## To Investigate

- [ ] Can some of the OpenStreetMap information be hidden? Eg, bus stops, business names, other POIs
- [ ] Does OpenStreetMap include information to show hilly areas?
- [ ] Consider adding security to the API endpoints
- [ ] Find your region somehow (IP address?) and set the default lat/lon based on that?
