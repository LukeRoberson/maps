# To Do List

- [ ] Remove the 'status' dropdown from maps, it's not useful
- [ ] Enable map editor to go full screen (or close to it)
- [ ] Suburb inherit default view from region, not project
- [ ] Individual inherit default view from suburb, not project
- [ ] Suburb and region boundaries should have a different colour, so they stand out as different
- [ ] Annotation:
  - [ ] Change marker colour to match layer colour
  - [ ] Centre align text label to marker
- [ ] Layers:
  - [ ] In a region map, assign suburbs to a layer
  - [ ] Add a suburb label to the suburb polygon
  - [ ] Some for maps within suburb


# Bugs

- [ ] Suburb map, editing the boundary, the region boundary disappears while editing
- [ ] It's letting me put a suburb boundary over a region boundary
- [ ] Changing bearing doesn't stick; As soon as we move the map, it resets
- [ ] Parent layers aren't being inherited


# To Investigate

- [ ] Can we zoom in partial increments?
